This is an example project for a blog series that demonstrates how to build a tightly-integrated technology stack that simplifies web-application development.

Technologies:

 * [Apache Wicket](http://wicket.apache.org) - Web Interface
 * [CDI](http://jcp.org/en/jsr/summary?id=299)/[Weld](http://seamframework.org/Weld) - Application Glue (Contexts, Inversion of Control, Eventing, Interceptors, etc)

Features:

 * Dependency injection into Wicket components
